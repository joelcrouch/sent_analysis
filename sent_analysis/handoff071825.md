## 1. Summary of Completed Tasks

Today, i successfully integrated the YouTube data collector and significantly enhanced the project's data visualization capabilities.

*   **YouTube Collector Integration:**
    *   The `google-api-python-client` library was installed into the virtual environment and added to `requirements.txt`.
    *   The user's YouTube Data API v3 key was added to the `.env` file.
    *   The `collect_youtube_data` function was successfully integrated into `main.py`, adding YouTube comments to the overall dataset.
    *   Robust error handling was added to the YouTube collector to gracefully skip videos where comments are disabled, preventing script interruptions.

*   **Visualization Enhancements:**
    *   **Replaced "Top Authors" Chart:** Based on user <me> feedback, the "Top Authors by Number of Posts" chart was removed from the main 2x2 visualization grid. It was replaced with the more insightful "Sentiment Distribution by Source" chart, which compares sentiment across Reddit, Bluesky, and YouTube for each query.
    *   **Created Detailed Trend Chart:** To address the "busyness" of the original trendline, a new, separate visualization was created: `detailed_sentiment_trend.png`. This larger chart provides a clearer view of sentiment over time and includes a 7-day rolling average to smooth the data and highlight underlying trends. The resulting chart is still kind of 'busy' but that may be jsut the way it is.
    *   A minor `FutureWarning` from the `seaborn` library was resolved.

## 2. Next Steps: Integrating News Outlets

The next major goal is to expand data collection to include established news outlets to compare journalistic sentiment with public sentiment from social media.

1.  **Commit Existing Changes:** The first step for the next session should be to commit the completed work from today. This includes the YouTube collector integration and all visualization improvements. A suggested commit message: `feat: Integrate YouTube collector and enhance visualizations`.

2.  **Implement New York Times Collector:**
    *   **User Action Required:** The user needs to obtain a free developer API key from the **New York Times Developer Portal** and add it to the `.env` file. A good variable name would be `NYT_API_KEY`.
    *   **Create New Collector:** A new file, `collectors/nytimes_collector.py`, will be created.
    *   **Develop Collector Logic:** The new collector will be implemented to:
        *   Use the NYT API key to authenticate.
        *   Fetch articles based on the existing search queries (`UAE`, `Qatar`).
        *   Parse the API response and format the data into the project's standard dictionary structure (including `source`, `id`, `text`, `author`, `created_at`, etc.).
    *   **Install Dependencies:** The `requests` library is likely sufficient, but i will confirm if any other packages are needed.

3.  **Integrate into `main.py`:**
    *   The new `nytimes_collector` will be imported and called from `main.py`.
    *   Its data will be appended to the `all_data` list to be included in the final analysis.

4.  **Run and Verify:**
    *   The full pipeline will be run to ensure that NYT data is collected correctly and integrated seamlessly into the existing sentiment analysis and visualizations, including the "Sentiment by Source" chart.
