  1. Project State & Architectural Overview

  The project has been refactored from a monolithic script into a modular,
  extensible architecture to support sentiment analysis from multiple social media
  platforms.


   * Core Structure:
       * collectors/: Contains individual Python modules for each social media platform
          (e.g., reddit_collector.py, bluesky_collector.py). Each collector's sole
         responsibility is to fetch data from its respective API and return it in a
         standardized dictionary format.
       * processor/sentiment_analyzer.py: Contains the core sentiment analysis logic
         (TextBlob, VADER), data processing, and visualization functions. This module
         is platform-agnostic.
       * main.py: The orchestrator script that loads credentials, calls various
         collectors, collates the data, and passes it to the SentimentProcessor.
       * venv/: Python virtual environment for project dependencies.
       * .env: Stores API credentials and other environment variables (ignored by
         Git).
       * trials_and_tribulations.md: A detailed log of errors encountered, attempted
         solutions, and final resolutions, along with architectural decisions.


   * Implemented Collectors:
       * Reddit (`collectors/reddit_collector.py`): Fully implemented and confirmed
         working on the user's local machine (though the agent's environment still
         encounters 401 errors, this is not blocking progress). It collects posts
         based on defined queries.
       * Bluesky (`collectors/bluesky_collector.py`): Fully implemented and
         successfully integrated. Initial errors related to API call parameters and
         object attribute access have been resolved. It collects skeets based on
         defined queries.


   * Sentiment Analysis & Visualization:
       * processor/sentiment_analyzer.py has been updated to perform analysis and
         generate visualizations that compare sentiment by `query` (e.g., 'UAE' vs.
         'Qatar') rather than by source. This allows for direct comparison of topics
         across platforms.
       * The ValueError related to timezone-aware datetimes has been resolved.


   * Git Status:
       * All changes up to the point of creating the feature/youtube-collector branch
         have been committed and pushed to the remote repository.
       * *.csv and *.png output files have been added to .gitignore.


   * Skipped Platform:
       * X/Twitter: Decision made to skip implementation due to severe API access
         limitations (1,500 tweets/month free tier) which would yield an insufficient
         sample size for meaningful analysis.

  2. Current Task: Implementing YouTube Collector

  The current task is to integrate a YouTube data collector into the system.


   * `collectors/youtube_collector.py`: This file has been created and contains the
     basic logic for searching YouTube videos and collecting comments from them.

  3. Next Steps for developer/agaent


   1. User(me-jc) Action Required: The user needs to obtain a YouTube Data API v3 key from the
      Google Cloud Console and add it to their .env file:

   1     YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key

   2. Complete `main.py` Integration: The previous replace operation to fully integrate
      the YouTube collector into main.py was cancelled. This needs to be re-executed.  ie the current feature branch is unpolluted.
      The goal is to:
       * Import collect_youtube_data in main.py.
       * Load YOUTUBE_API_KEY from .env.
       * Add a block in main.py to call collect_youtube_data for each query and extend
         all_data with the results, similar to the Reddit and Bluesky blocks.
   3. Install Dependencies:  install the google-api-python-client, and any other google-goggly req's, pip freeze the lot, and move on with your life
      library into the virtual environment:


   1     ./venv/bin/python -m pip install google-api-python-client <-  probably more, but unknown r.n.

   4. Run and Verify: Once the above steps are complete, instruct the user to run
      main.py to verify that data is being collected from YouTube and integrated into
      the analysis.


   1     ./venv/bin/python main.py

   5. Troubleshoot: Be prepared to troubleshoot any new errors that arise during
      YouTube data collection (e.g., API key issues, data parsing errors, rate limits).

  This hand-off should provide all the necessary context for a fresh start. ie you are going to forget everything you  have ever done as soon as you sleep.
